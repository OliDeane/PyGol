# PyGol
PyGol is novel Inductive Logic Programming(ILP) system based on **Meta Inverse Entailment(MIE)**.  MIE is similar to Mode-Directed Inverse Entailment (MDIE) but does not require mode declarations.

PyGol has written in **Python**(Learning Phase) and, during the test phase, uses **Pyswip** to have fare analysis with logic programming. 

## Contributions
* An ILP approach **Meta Inverse Entailment(MIE)**
* An algorithm to generate **Meta Clause Set(MCS) **
* Defining Most Speific Clause using MCS
* A new **higher-order** language bias **Meta Theory(MT)** - Automatically generating from MCS
* **Abductive Learning** using MIE
* Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE) for the purpose of automated data science
