# PyGol
A novel Inductive Logic Programming(ILP) system based on Auto Inverse Entailment &amp; Bottom Theory based using Python.

## Contributions
* An ILP approach Meta Inverse Entailment(MIE)
* An algorithm to generate Meta Clause Set(MCS) 
* Defining Most Speific Clause using MCS
* A new language bias Meta Theory(MT) - Automatically generating from MCS
* Abductive Learning MIE
* Automatic conversion of typical  data science dataset to ILP dataset
